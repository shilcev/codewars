There's a waiting room with N chairs set in single row. Chairs are consecutively numbered from 1 to N. First is closest to the entrance (which is exit as well).

For some reason people choose a chair in the following way

Find a place as far from other people as possible
Find a place as close to exit as possible
All chairs must be occupied before the first person will be served

So it looks like this for 10 chairs and 10 patients
